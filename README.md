# prflow.dev
prflow.dev is a service that computes team metrics and sends report to slack.

I'm a team lead who was looking for a simple way to get key team statistics from github. There are a few options available on the market, but they are mostly closed source and relatively expensive, so I wanted to build a cheaper version that's simplified to exactly what I need.  

This is still in very early phases, hopefully it will get better with time!
