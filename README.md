# prflow.dev: Simplified Team Metrics for GitHub

prflow.dev is an open-source service that computes essential team metrics from GitHub repositories and delivers insightful reports directly to Slack. It's designed to provide team leads with actionable data to improve productivity, streamline workflows, and foster collaboration—all in a lightweight, accessible package.

## Why prflow.dev?
As a team lead, I was looking for a straightforward solution to gather key team statistics from GitHub. While several tools exist in the market, they often fall into two categories:

1. Closed-source and proprietary: These solutions lock you into their ecosystems and limit customizability.
2. Expensive and feature-bloated: Many tools are priced for large enterprises and include features you may not need.
prflow.dev was born out of a desire for an affordable, open-source alternative tailored to exactly what I needed: a simple, focused way to monitor my team's pull request activity and overall performance.

## Features

* Automated Metrics Computation: Aggregates GitHub data into clear, actionable metrics.
* Slack Integration: Sends daily or weekly reports directly to your team's Slack channels.
* Customizable Insights: Focus on the statistics that matter most for your team.
* Open Source: Free to use, adapt, and contribute to.


## Example Use Cases

### Monitor Team Performance
Get a bird’s-eye view of how your team is progressing. Metrics like the number of pull requests merged, average review times, and code contributions help identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement.

### Track Productivity Trends
Spot trends in team activity over time to measure the impact of process changes, holidays, or other factors influencing productivity.

### Foster Transparency
Share metrics with your team to encourage accountability and celebrate successes.

## Roadmap
